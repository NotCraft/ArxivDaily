However, in practice,\ntransformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a \"chain of\nthought\" or \"scratchpad\", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of\nintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such\nintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a\ndecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of\nincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For\ninstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of\ndecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard\ntransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a\nslight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under\nstandard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our\nresults also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within\ncontext-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm\nmake them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems --\nthe first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard\ncomplexity classes.

In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract,\nthe first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of\nrole-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of\nsocial interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and\ncovers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and\n30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations\non this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find\nthat agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in\ngroup level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the\ninfluence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on\nRoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social\ninteraction of role-playing conversational agents.

It is a typical example that the model knows \"A's father is\nB\", but is unable to reason \"B's child is A\". This limitation poses a challenge\nto the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a\ngap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In\nthis paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root\ncause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the\ntraining and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language\nmodels to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly,\npermutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since\nthis can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous\npermutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing\nchallenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address\nthis issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which\naddresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units\n(i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting\nthese units before feeding into the model.

Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked\ninterest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based\nuser embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As\nusers continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be\nperiodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior\npatterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack\nmemory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and\nuse only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both\ncases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and\nreflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing\nby storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior\nprediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting\na broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors.

However,\nour analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining\nwill lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the\ntraining data (like references to publications such as articles and books,\nwhose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on\nsystematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different\narchitectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of\nhallucinations.\n","authors":["Adam Tauman Kalai","Santosh S.

To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of\ntext-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers',\nenabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions\nthrough various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably\nperforms in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described\nproperty requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an\naverage molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 88.08%, 65.27%, and\n61.44%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot\ntesting, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have\nnot been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language\nstyles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through\nempirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG\ncontributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative\napproach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data\nscarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains\nof drug discovery and materials science.

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel\ninference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight specific\nprompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated by\nthe classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional\ncontext pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the\nautoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way.\nNotably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted\ntokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs.

The Misleading Success of\n  Simulating Social Interactions With LLMs","summary":"  Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social\nsimulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena with LLM-based\nagents. However, most work has used an omniscient perspective on these\nsimulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is\nfundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric\ninteractions that humans have. To examine these differences, we develop an\nevaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various\nsettings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that interlocutors\nsimulated omnisciently are much more successful at accomplishing social goals\ncompared to non-omniscient agents, despite the latter being the more realistic\nsetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learning from omniscient simulations\nimproves the apparent naturalness of interactions but scarcely enhances goal\nachievement in cooperative scenarios. Our findings indicate that addressing\ninformation asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents.\n","authors":["Xuhui Zhou","Zhe Su","Tiwalayo Eisape","Hyunwoo Kim","Maarten Sap"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05020v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05342v4","updated":"2024-03-20T20:37:17Z","published":"2023-08-10T05:10:17Z","title":"Metacognitive Prompting Improves Understanding in Large Language Models","summary":"  In Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been consistent advancements in\ntask-specific performance, largely influenced by effective prompt design.\nRecent advancements in prompting have enhanced reasoning in logic-intensive\ntasks for LLMs, yet the nuanced understanding abilities of these models,\ncrucial for processing and interpreting complex information, remain\nunderexplored.

In this work, we find under feature map\ndropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not\nchange much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable\nposition changes. We compute the box stability score (BoS score) to reflect\nthis stability. Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of\nbounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout.

To answer these questions and more, we\nintroduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks\ninvolving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and\nimage processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide\nautomatically generated plans using this realistic toolset.

However, there are other groups of users\nwith different types of disabilities that also need software tooling support to\nimprove their experience.

Motor-impaired users often have limited ability to\ninteract with touch-based devices, and instead may make use of a switch or\nother assistive mechanism -- hence UIs must be designed to support both limited\ntouch gestures and the use of assistive devices. MotorEase adapts computer\nvision and text processing techniques to enable a semantic understanding of app\nUI screens, enabling the detection of violations related to four popular,\npreviously unexplored UI design guidelines that support motor-impaired users,\nincluding: (i) visual touch target size, (ii) expanding sections, (iii)\npersisting elements, and (iv) adjacent icon visual distance.

By incorporating these consistency modules\ninto an iterative pattern, VcEdit proficiently resolves the issue of multi-view\ninconsistency, facilitating high-quality 3DGS editing across a diverse range of\nscenes.\n","authors":["Yuxuan Wang","Xuanyu Yi","Zike Wu","Na Zhao","Long Chen","Hanwang Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11868v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13663v1","updated":"2024-03-20T15:14:22Z","published":"2024-03-20T15:14:22Z","title":"T-Pixel2Mesh: Combining Global and Local Transformer for 3D Mesh\n  Generation from a Single Image","summary":"  Pixel2Mesh (P2M) is a classical approach for reconstructing 3D shapes from a\nsingle color image through coarse-to-fine mesh deformation.

Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency.

Despite the remarkable performance\nof previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to\nthe well-annotated data.

In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from\nthe Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.\nTraining with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges --\nenforcing the multimodal samples to \\emph{align incorrect semantics} and\n\\emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. To\ntackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based\non Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval. First, we propose a\nsemantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy\nlabels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend\ndifferent modalities and provide precise transport cost.

Recent works propose using\nlearned spatial indexes to improve spatial query performance by optimizing the\nstorage layout or internal search structures according to the data\ndistribution. However, only a few learned indexes exploit the query workload\ndistribution to enhance their performance. In addition, building and updating\nlearned spatial indexes are often costly on large datasets due to the\ninefficiency of (re)training ML models. In this paper, we present WaZI, a\nlearned and workload-aware variant of the Z-index, which jointly optimizes the\nstorage layout and search structures, as a viable solution for the above\nchallenges of spatial indexing. Specifically, we first formulate a cost\nfunction to measure the performance of a Z-index on a dataset for a range-query\nworkload. Then, we optimize the Z-index structure by minimizing the cost\nfunction through adaptive partitioning and ordering for index construction.\nMoreover, we design a novel page-skipping mechanism to improve the query\nperformance of WaZI by reducing access to irrelevant data pages. Our extensive\nexperiments show that the WaZI index improves range query time by 40% on\naverage over the baselines while always performing better or comparably to\nstate-of-the-art spatial indexes.

In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from\nthe Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.\nTraining with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges --\nenforcing the multimodal samples to \\emph{align incorrect semantics} and\n\\emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. To\ntackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based\non Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval.

However, the\nperformance of MLLMs declines with an increase in category numbers, primarily\ndue to growing complexity and constraints of limited context window size. To\nsynergize the strengths of both approaches and enhance the few-shot/zero-shot\nrecognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained\nvocabularies, this paper introduces RAR, a Retrieving And Ranking augmented\nmethod for MLLMs. We initially establish a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP\nto create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the\nimmediate context window.

However, in practice,\ntransformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a \"chain of\nthought\" or \"scratchpad\", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of\nintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such\nintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a\ndecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of\nincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For\ninstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of\ndecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard\ntransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a\nslight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under\nstandard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our\nresults also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within\ncontext-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm\nmake them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems --\nthe first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard\ncomplexity classes.

However, there exist other valid choices of\ndivergences, and when $\\mathcal{Q}$ does not contain~$p$, each divergence\nchampions a different solution. We analyze how the choice of divergence affects\nthe outcome of VI when a Gaussian with a dense covariance matrix is\napproximated by a Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix. In this setting\nwe show that different divergences can be \\textit{ordered} by the amount that\ntheir variational approximations misestimate various measures of uncertainty,\nsuch as the variance, precision, and entropy. We also derive an impossibility\ntheorem showing that no two of these measures can be simultaneously matched by\na factorized approximation; hence, the choice of divergence informs which\nmeasure, if any, is correctly estimated.

We\npropose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients:\n1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis\nbased on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate\ntextual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal\nAttention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the\ntemporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables\ncontrol over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of\nthe proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over\nexisting open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal\nattention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of\napplying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.\n","authors":["Yumeng Li","William Beluch","Margret Keuper","Dan Zhang","Anna Khoreva"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13501v1.pdf","comment":"Project page: https://yumengli007.github.io/VSTAR"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20204v3","updated":"2024-03-20T10:52:03Z","published":"2023-10-31T06:04:18Z","title":"General-Purpose Retrieval-Enhanced Medical Prediction Model Using\n  Near-Infinite History","summary":"  Developing clinical prediction models (e.g., mortality prediction) based on\nelectronic health records (EHRs) typically relies on expert opinion for feature\nselection and adjusting observation window size.

The experiment results show that: ALBERT\nachieves the best performance (f1-score: 0.9584) of identifying assumptions on\nthe AssuEval dataset, which is much better than the other models (the 2nd best\nf1-score is 0.6211, achieved by ChatGPT). Though ChatGPT is the most popular\nlarge language model, we do not recommend using it to identify assumptions in\nDL framework development because of its low performance on the task.\nFine-tuning ChatGPT specifically for assumption identification could improve\nthe performance. This study provides researchers with the largest dataset of\nassumptions for further research (e.g., assumption classification, evaluation,\nand reasoning) and helps practitioners better understand assumptions and how to\nmanage them in their projects.\n","authors":["Chen Yang","Peng Liang","Zinan Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03653v3.pdf","comment":"28 pages, 15 images, 10 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal\n  (2024)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13370v1","updated":"2024-03-20T08:04:00Z","published":"2024-03-20T08:04:00Z","title":"Counting Network for Learning from Majority Label","summary":"  The paper proposes a novel problem in multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning\n(MIL) called Learning from the Majority Label (LML).

However,\ntraditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,\nsuch as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle\nConsistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of\ncycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval\ninconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle\nsegments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To\nencapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes\nconsistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss\n(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence\namong cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of\ncycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the\nRepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in\nVAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional\nadaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming\nexisting models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the\nneed for dataset-specific optimization.

To answer these questions and more, we\nintroduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks\ninvolving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and\nimage processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide\nautomatically generated plans using this realistic toolset.

With m&m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies\n(multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3\ntypes of feedback (parsing/verification/execution).

By focusing on the\nsemantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective\non the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much\ngreater complexity and capabilities.

Yet\ndue to substantial differences in learning pressures, it is questionable\nwhether the similarity between humans and machines is sufficient for insights\nto carry over and to be worth testing with human participants. Here, we review\nthe emergent communication literature, a subfield of multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning, from a language evolution perspective. We find that the emergent\ncommunication literature excels at designing and adapting models to recover\ninitially absent linguistic phenomena of natural languages. Based on a short\nliterature review, we identify key pressures that have recovered initially\nabsent human patterns in emergent communication models: communicative success,\nefficiency, learnability, and other psycho-/sociolinguistic factors. We argue\nthat this may serve as inspiration for how to design language models for\nlanguage acquisition and language evolution research.\n","authors":["Lukas Galke","Limor Raviv"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14427v1.pdf","comment":"12 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14409v1","updated":"2024-03-21T13:57:43Z","published":"2024-03-21T13:57:43Z","title":"Locating and Mitigating Gender Bias in Large Language Models","summary":"  Large language models(LLM) are pre-trained on extensive corpora to learn\nfacts and human cognition which contain human preferences.

Because of the huge number\nof patents, their length, and, last but not least, their complexity there is a\nneed for modern patent retrieval and patent analysis to go beyond\nkeyword-oriented methods. Recent advances in patent retrieval and analysis\nmainly focus on dense vectors based on neural AI Transformer language models\nlike Google BERT. They are, for example, used for dense retrieval, question\nanswering or summarization and key concept extraction. A research focus within\nthe methods for patent summarization and key concept extraction are generic\ninventive concepts respectively TRIZ concepts like problems, solutions,\nadvantage of invention, parameters, and contradictions. Succeeding rule-based\napproaches, finetuned BERT-like language models for sentence-wise\nclassification represent the state-of-the-art of inventive concept extraction.\nWhile they work comparatively well for basic concepts like problems or\nsolutions, contradictions - as a more complex abstraction - remain a challenge\nfor these models.

However, these advancements have also introduced\nadditional safety risks and raised concerns regarding their detrimental impact\non already marginalized populations. Despite growing mitigation efforts to\ndevelop safety safeguards, such as supervised safety-oriented fine-tuning and\nleveraging safe reinforcement learning from human feedback, multiple concerns\nregarding the safety and ingrained biases in these models remain. Furthermore,\nprevious work has demonstrated that models optimized for safety often display\nexaggerated safety behaviors, such as a tendency to refrain from responding to\ncertain requests as a precautionary measure. As such, a clear trade-off between\nthe helpfulness and safety of these models has been documented in the\nliterature. In this paper, we further investigate the effectiveness of safety\nmeasures by evaluating models on already mitigated biases. Using the case of\nLlama 2 as an example, we illustrate how LLMs' safety responses can still\nencode harmful assumptions. To do so, we create a set of non-toxic prompts,\nwhich we then use to evaluate Llama models.

For example, humans spend long hours of their time on web pages, where\ntext is intertwined with other modalities and tasks are accomplished in the\nform of various complex interactions. Can state-of-the-art multi-modal models\ngeneralize to such complex domains?\n  To address this question, we introduce TurkingBench, a benchmark of tasks\nformulated as web pages containing textual instructions with multi-modal\ncontext. Unlike existing work which employs artificially synthesized web pages,\nhere we use natural HTML pages that were originally designed for crowdsourcing\nworkers for various annotation purposes. The HTML instructions of each task are\nalso instantiated with various values (obtained from the crowdsourcing tasks)\nto form new instances of the task. This benchmark contains 32.2K instances\ndistributed across 158 tasks.\n  Additionally, to facilitate the evaluation on TurkingBench, we develop an\nevaluation framework that connects the responses of chatbots to modifications\non web pages (modifying a text box, checking a radio, etc.). We evaluate the\nperformance of state-of-the-art models, including language-only, vision-only,\nand layout-only models, and their combinations, on this benchmark.

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of\n80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks.

These degradations typically\narise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient\nconditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous\nspecialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific\ntype of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant\nattention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model\nwithout requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However,\nthese methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the\ndistinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To\naddress this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network\nbased on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that different degradation types impact the image content on\ndifferent frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each\nrestoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency\ninformation from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra\nof the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a\nbidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency\ncomponents. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input\nfor a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves\nadaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands\naccording to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different\nimage restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motion\ndeblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

These years, CNN-based and Transformer-based models\nhave been widely used to classify various medical images. Unfortunately, The\nlimitation of CNNs in long-range modeling capabilities prevents them from\neffectively extracting features in medical images, while Transformers are\nhampered by their quadratic computational complexity. Recent research has shown\nthat the state space model (SSM) represented by Mamba can efficiently model\nlong-range interactions while maintaining linear computational complexity.\nInspired by this, we propose Vision Mamba for medical image classification\n(MedMamba). More specifically, we introduce a novel Conv-SSM module. Conv-SSM\ncombines the local feature extraction ability of convolutional layers with the\nability of SSM to capture long-range dependency, thereby modeling medical\nimages with different modalities. To demonstrate the potential of MedMamba, we\nconducted extensive experiments using 14 publicly available medical datasets\nwith different imaging techniques and two private datasets built by ourselves.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MedMamba performs\nwell in detecting lesions in various medical images.

Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with\ncompact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or\nquantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly\ntraining the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards\nlow-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the\naccuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution\nkernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We\nfound that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be\ntruncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but\nnot in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation\ncompression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how\ninformation is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated\nmodels could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs\nof re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of\nconvolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum.

We believe that producing DeepFakes that are highly\nrealistic and 'detection evasive' can serve the ultimate goal of improving\nfuture generation DeepFake detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images\nwithout hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch\nfiltering. We first demonstrate that frequency-domain notch filtering, although\nfamously shown to be effective in removing periodic noise in the spatial\ndomain, is infeasible for our task at hand due to the manual designs required\nfor the notch filters. We, therefore, resort to a learning-based approach to\nreproduce the notch filtering effects, but solely in the spatial domain. We\nadopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking the\nperiodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-free\nfake images, and we name our method DeepNotch. Deep image filtering provides a\nspecialized filter for each pixel in the noisy image, producing filtered images\nwith high fidelity compared to their DeepFake counterparts. Moreover, we also\nuse the semantic information of the image to generate an adversarial guidance\nmap to add noise intelligently.

To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively\ntreat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment\nit with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG.\nRecently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and\nhas gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune\nthe retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved\ndocuments as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual\nInformation. The LLM preferred documents may not contain the factual\ninformation for the given question, which can mislead the retriever and hurt\nthe effectiveness of black-box RAG; (2) Waste of Tokens. Simply concatenating\nall the retrieved documents brings large amounts of unnecessary tokens for\nLLMs, which degenerates the efficiency of black-box RAG. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a novel black-box RAG framework which utilizes the\nfactual information in the retrieval and reduces the number of tokens for\naugmentation, dubbed FIT-RAG. FIT-RAG utilizes the factual information by\nconstructing a bi-label document scorer.

We introduce a trainable style encoder to\nextract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges\nstyle information from multiple style inputs. This architecture enables the\ngeneration of images with unseen styles in a zero-shot manner, by leveraging\nstyles from unseen images, resulting in more diverse generations. In this work,\nwe use the image layout as target condition and first show the capability of\nour method on a natural image dataset as a proof-of-concept. We further\ndemonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge\nabout tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic\nimages with known layouts. This allows us to generate additional synthetic data\nto train a segmentation network in a semi-supervised fashion. We verify the\nadded value of the generated images by showing improved segmentation results\nand lower performance variability between patients when synthetic images are\nincluded during segmentation training.

Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We\nfound that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be\ntruncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but\nnot in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation\ncompression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how\ninformation is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated\nmodels could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs\nof re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of\nconvolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our\nresults can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.\n","authors":["Sukhbinder Singh","Saeed S.

In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel\ntraining-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary\nsteps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.\nInstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an\nexisting image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion\nand feature injection.

Therefore, safeguarding face\nrecognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing\nlearning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding\ndetection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer\nsignificant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies\nseek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the\npresentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these\nmethods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth\nand infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity\nmobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when\neither modality is missing or of poor quality.

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of\n80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks.

Then the full bones are\nreconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining shape and\nlandmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to\ndesign patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been trained using\n91 CT scans of lower limb and evaluated on 41 CT scans manually segmented, in\nterms of accuracy and execution time.\n  The workflow accuracy was $0.4\\pm0.2mm$ for the segmentation, $1.2\\pm0.4mm$\nfor the full bones reconstruction, and $2.8\\pm2.2mm$ for the anatomical\nlandmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with\n$0.6\\pm0.2mm$ accuracy.

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution\npixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to\nhierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on\nlow-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural\nchoices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions\nsignificantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and\nslow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for\nefficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The\nkey principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during\ntraining, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local\ninteractions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between\ntokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the\nhigh-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this\nstrategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary\nembeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and\nit is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We\napply this strategy to three dense prediction tasks with high-resolution data.\nFirst, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with\n2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win.

In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of\nVLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We\nfind that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated\nby maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose\nverbose images, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to\ninduce VLMs to generate long sentences during inference.

Our key insight lies in introducing additional temporal cues besides the\nprovided reference. To this end, we generate temporal pseudo-references from\nthe given stylized reference. These pseudo-references facilitate the\npropagation of style information from the reference to the entire dynamic 3D\nscene. For coarse style transfer, we enforce novel views and times to mimic the\nstyle details present in pseudo-references at the feature level. To preserve\nhigh-frequency details, we create a collection of stylized temporal pseudo-rays\nfrom temporal pseudo-references. These pseudo-rays serve as detailed and\nexplicit stylization guidance for achieving fine style transfer. Experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method yields\nplausible stylized results of space-time view synthesis on dynamic 3D scenes.\n","authors":["Xingyi Li","Zhiguo Cao","Yizheng Wu","Kewei Wang","Ke Xian","Zhe Wang","Guosheng Lin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06205v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted by CVPR 2024.

In applications such\nas autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are\nusually passed through a \"virtual sensor\" realized by a deep learning model, to\nproduce \"measurements\" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a\ntracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are\naccumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We\nargue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information,\nand therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal\ninformation, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the\nend of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called\nMULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object,\na pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the\ninput buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly\nused lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the\nresulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not\nonly to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct\nmore sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by\nthe pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death\nmodels.

However, its direct adaption in medical image\nsegmentation tasks shows significant performance drops with inferior accuracy\nand unstable results. It may also requires an excessive number of prompt points\nto obtain a reasonable accuracy. For segmenting 3D radiological CT or MRI\nscans, a 2D SAM model has to separately handle hundreds of 2D slices. Although\nquite a few studies explore adapting SAM into medical image volumes, the\nefficiency of 2D adaption methods is unsatisfactory and 3D adaptation methods\nonly capable of segmenting specific organs/tumors. In this work, we propose a\ncomprehensive and scalable 3D SAM model for whole-body CT segmentation, named\nCT-SAM3D. Instead of adapting SAM, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation\nmodel using a (nearly) fully labeled CT dataset. To train CT-SAM3D effectively,\nensuring the model's accurate responses to higher-dimensional spatial prompts\nis crucial, and 3D patch-wise training is required due to GPU memory\nconstraints. For this purpose, we propose two key technical developments: 1) a\nprogressively and spatially aligned prompt encoding method to effectively\nencode click prompts in local 3D space; and 2) a cross-patch prompt learning\nscheme to capture more 3D spatial context, which is beneficial for reducing the\nediting workloads when interactively prompting on large organs.

The SLAM module utilizes a\nvideo stream and additional scale-sensitive readings to estimate camera poses\nand metric depth.

The object pose is estimated through geometric\nregistration of these canonical object representations with estimated object\ndepth points.

To solve above problems,\nwe propose a brand-new learning paradigm, termed \"Data Amplify Learning (DAL),\"\nalongside a compact makeup model named \"TinyBeauty.\" The core idea of DAL lies\nin employing a Diffusion-based Data Amplifier (DDA) to \"amplify\" limited images\nfor the model training, thereby enabling accurate pixel-to-pixel supervision\nwith merely a handful of annotations. Two pivotal innovations in DDA facilitate\nthe above training approach: (1) A Residual Diffusion Model (RDM) is designed\nto generate high-fidelity detail and circumvent the detail vanishing problem in\nthe vanilla diffusion models; (2) A Fine-Grained Makeup Module (FGMM) is\nproposed to achieve precise makeup control and combination while retaining face\nidentity. Coupled with DAL, TinyBeauty necessitates merely 80K parameters to\nachieve a state-of-the-art performance without intricate face prompts.\nMeanwhile, TinyBeauty achieves a remarkable inference speed of up to 460 fps on\nthe iPhone 13.

Inspired by\nmasked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and\npartially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the\ndependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked\npatches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be\nan optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning\nto embed patches independently results in better time series representations.\nSpecifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which\nautoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple\npatch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce\ncomplementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time\nseries information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series\nforecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art\nTransformer-based models, while it is more efficient in terms of the number of\nparameters and training/inference time.

However, contrasting similar time series\ninstances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to\nignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality\nof learned representations. To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple\nyet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is\nachieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft\nassignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments\nfor 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on\nthe data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of\ntimestamps.

In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel\ntraining-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary\nsteps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.\nInstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an\nexisting image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion\nand feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.\nBeyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support\nnovel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,\nsubject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by\nprevious methods.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the\nattention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods\nintroduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring\nadditional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a\ntraining-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking\nmulti-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to\nattend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer\nsequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to\nprocess in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context\nchunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the\ninherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently\ndistributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures\nit can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while\ndifferent heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts.\nLongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that\nuse relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k\nlength on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending\nthe usable context window for existing models.

To tackle the challenges presented by the uneven\ndistribution of curb features on the xy-plane and their reliance on z-axis\nhigh-frequency features, we introduce the multi-scale and channel attention\n(MSCA) module, a bespoke solution designed to optimize detection performance.\nMoreover, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function group, specifically\nformulated to counteract the imbalance in the distribution of curb point clouds\nrelative to other categories. Our extensive experimentation on 2 major datasets\nhas yielded results that surpass existing benchmarks set by leading curb\ndetection and point cloud segmentation models. By integrating multi-clustering\nand curve fitting techniques in our post-processing stage, we have\nsubstantially reduced noise in curb detection, thereby enhancing precision to\n0.8744. Notably, CurbNet has achieved an exceptional average metrics of over\n0.95 at a tolerance of just 0.15m, thereby establishing a new benchmark.\nFurthermore, corroborative real-world experiments and dataset analyzes mutually\nvalidate each other, solidifying CurbNet's superior detection proficiency and\nits robust generalizability.\n","authors":["Guoyang Zhao","Fulong Ma","Yuxuan Liu","Weiqing Qi","Ming Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16794v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16788v1","updated":"2024-03-25T14:02:33Z","published":"2024-03-25T14:02:33Z","title":"HPL-ESS: Hybrid Pseudo-Labeling for Unsupervised Event-based Semantic\n  Segmentation","summary":"  Event-based semantic segmentation has gained popularity due to its capability\nto deal with scenarios under high-speed motion and extreme lighting conditions,\nwhich cannot be addressed by conventional RGB cameras. Since it is hard to\nannotate event data, previous approaches rely on event-to-image reconstruction\nto obtain pseudo labels for training. However, this will inevitably introduce\nnoise, and learning from noisy pseudo labels, especially when generated from a\nsingle source, may reinforce the errors. This drawback is also called\nconfirmation bias in pseudo-labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid\npseudo-labeling framework for unsupervised event-based semantic segmentation,\nHPL-ESS, to alleviate the influence of noisy pseudo labels. In particular, we\nfirst employ a plain unsupervised domain adaptation framework as our baseline,\nwhich can generate a set of pseudo labels through self-training. Then, we\nincorporate offline event-to-image reconstruction into the framework, and\nobtain another set of pseudo labels by predicting segmentation maps on the\nreconstructed images. A noisy label learning strategy is designed to mix the\ntwo sets of pseudo labels and enhance the quality. Moreover, we propose a soft\nprototypical alignment module to further improve the consistency of target\ndomain features.

An\nimportant aspect is their transferability, which refers to their ability to\ndeceive other models, thus enabling attacks in the black-box setting. Though\nvarious methods have been proposed to boost transferability, the performance\nstill falls short compared with white-box attacks. In this work, we observe\nthat existing input transformation based attacks, one of the mainstream\ntransfer-based attacks, result in different attention heatmaps on various\nmodels, which might limit the transferability. We also find that breaking the\nintrinsic relation of the image can disrupt the attention heatmap of the\noriginal image. Based on this finding, we propose a novel input transformation\nbased attack called block shuffle and rotation (BSR). Specifically, BSR splits\nthe input image into several blocks, then randomly shuffles and rotates these\nblocks to construct a set of new images for gradient calculation. Empirical\nevaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that BSR could achieve\nsignificantly better transferability than the existing input transformation\nbased methods under single-model and ensemble-model settings.

However, previous work rarely paid attention to data\nwith anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance\nimaging views.

To reduce costs in practice, low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object\ndetection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However, relying\nsolely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object\ndetection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras\nwith the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable\nmulti-modal 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a\nradar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV).\nSpecifically, we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction.\nRadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section\n(RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone, a point-based\nencoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features,\nwith an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the\ntwo encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to\nscattering the point feature in BEV. Besides, we present the Cross-Attention\nMulti-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature\nfrom radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism, and then fuse\nthe feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show\nthat RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on\nnuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks.

One of the most common\ncharacteristics of count data is the inherent branching structure described by\na binomial thinning operator and an independent Poisson distribution that\ncaptures both branching and noise. For instance, in a population count\nscenario, mortality and immigration contribute to the count, where survival\nfollows a Bernoulli distribution, and immigration follows a Poisson\ndistribution. However, causal discovery from such data is challenging due to\nthe non-identifiability issue: a single causal pair is Markov equivalent, i.e.,\n$X\\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\\rightarrow X$ are distributed equivalent. Fortunately,\nin this work, we found that the causal order from $X$ to its child $Y$ is\nidentifiable if $X$ is a root vertex and has at least two directed paths to\n$Y$, or the ancestor of $X$ with the most directed path to $X$ has a directed\npath to $Y$ without passing $X$. Specifically, we propose a Poisson Branching\nStructure Causal Model (PB-SCM) and perform a path analysis on PB-SCM using\nhigh-order cumulants. Theoretical results establish the connection between the\npath and cumulant and demonstrate that the path information can be obtained\nfrom the cumulant. With the path information, causal order is identifiable\nunder some graphical conditions.

To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN\n(Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively\nconsidering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow.\nFirst, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked\nsubseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context\nin a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and\ncontextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series.\nThen, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by\nusing stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are\nextracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making\ntime-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn\nfine-grained short-term temporal features.

We suggest that such a set of rules\nseem more natural to be understood compared to a mixture of large and small\nrules. The approach based on MaxSAT, called IMLI, presents a technique to\nincrease performance that involves learning a set of rules by incrementally\napplying the model in a dataset. Finally, IMLIB and IMLI are compared using\ndiverse databases. IMLIB obtained results comparable to IMLI in terms of\naccuracy, generating more balanced rules with smaller sizes.\n","authors":["Ant√¥nio Carlos Souza Ferreira J√∫nior","Thiago Alves Rocha"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16418v1.pdf","comment":"16 pages, 5 tables, submitted to BRACIS 2023 (Brazilian Conference on\n  Intelligent Systems), accepted version published in Intelligent Systems,\n  LNCS, vol 14195"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05654v3","updated":"2024-03-25T04:32:19Z","published":"2023-12-09T19:42:36Z","title":"Spectral methods for Neural Integral Equations","summary":"  Neural integral equations are deep learning models based on the theory of\nintegral equations, where the model consists of an integral operator and the\ncorresponding equation (of the second kind) which is learned through an\noptimization procedure.

Detection of errors is the first step to mitigating their\nimpact on a system and thus, efficient error detection for LLMs is an important\nissue. In many settings, the LLM is considered as a black box with no access to\nthe internal nodes; this prevents the use of many error detection schemes that\nneed access to the model's internal nodes. An interesting observation is that\nthe output of LLMs in error-free operation should be valid and normal text.\nTherefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from normal\ntext, it is likely that there is an error. Based on this observation we propose\nto perform Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED); this scheme extracts\nsome linguistic features of the text generated by the LLM and feeds them to a\nconcurrent classifier that detects errors. Since the proposed error detection\nmechanism only relies on the outputs of the model, then it can be used on LLMs\nin which there is no access to the internal nodes. The proposed CLED scheme has\nbeen evaluated on the T5 model when used for news summarization and on the\nOPUS-MT model when used for translation. In both cases, the same set of\nlinguistic features has been used for error detection to illustrate the\napplicability of the proposed scheme beyond a specific case. The results show\nthat CLED can detect most of the errors at a low overhead penalty. The use of\nthe concurrent classifier also enables a trade-off between error detection\neffectiveness and its associated overhead, so providing flexibility to a\ndesigner.\n","authors":["Jinhua Zhu","Javier Conde","Zhen Gao","Pedro Reviriego","Shanshan Liu","Fabrizio Lombardi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16393v1.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 6 figures, 30 references"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16391v1","updated":"2024-03-25T03:13:56Z","published":"2024-03-25T03:13:56Z","title":"Physics-informed RL for Maximal Safety Probability Estimation","summary":"  Accurate risk quantification and reachability analysis are crucial for safe\ncontrol and learning, but sampling from rare events, risky states, or long-term\ntrajectories can be prohibitively costly.

Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial when\nshaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e., image-to-video\ngeneration). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion\nprocess of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful\nalignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among\nadjacent frames. To alleviate this, we present TRIP, a new recipe of\nimage-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from\nstatic image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the\ncoherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically, the\nimage noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process\nbased on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next, TRIP executes a\nresidual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that\ndirectly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to\namplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a\nresidual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent\ncodes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning, thereby easing the learning\nof the residual noise for each frame. Furthermore, both reference and residual\nnoise of each frame are dynamically merged via attention mechanism for final\nvideo generation.

Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of\nextending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often\nunderperform in practical long-context applications.

Finally, ESREAL employs\na proximal policy optimization algorithm, where it selectively penalizes\nhallucinated tokens according to their token-level hallucination scores. Our\nframework notably reduces hallucinations in LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2\nby 32.81%, 27.08%, and 7.46% on the CHAIR metric.

This\nposes risks of leakage, including personal information, copyrighted texts, and\nbenchmark datasets. Such leakage leads to undermining human trust in AI due to\npotential unauthorized generation of content or overestimation of performance.\nWe establish the following three criteria concerning the leakage issues: (1)\nleakage rate: the proportion of leaked data in training data, (2) output rate:\nthe ease of generating leaked data, and (3) detection rate: the detection\nperformance of leaked versus non-leaked data. Despite the leakage rate being\nthe origin of data leakage issues, it is not understood how it affects the\noutput rate and detection rate. In this paper, we conduct an experimental\nsurvey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate and both the\noutput rate and detection rate for personal information, copyrighted texts, and\nbenchmark data. Additionally, we propose a self-detection approach that uses\nfew-shot learning in which LLMs detect whether instances are present or absent\nin their training data, in contrast to previous methods that do not employ\nexplicit learning. To explore the ease of generating leaked information, we\ncreate a dataset of prompts designed to elicit personal information,\ncopyrighted text, and benchmarks from LLMs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs\nproduce leaked information in most cases despite less such data in their\ntraining set.

In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara),\nan end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions\ninto their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase\nLM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or\ninstruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The\nensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt\nwithout altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decreasing the\nperplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore in\ndetail both greedy and search-based decoding as two alternative decoding\nschemes of MonoPara.

In this study, we conduct a meticulous\nanalysis of the MovieLens dataset and explain the potential impact of using the\ndataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. We make a few main findings\nfrom our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user\ninteractions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens\nplatform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affects\nthe subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by\nthe candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal\nrecommendation algorithm(s). Third, changing the order of user interactions\nmakes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to capture the progressive\ninteraction process.

In summary, the MovieLens platform\ndemonstrates an efficient and effective way of collecting user preferences to\naddress cold-starts. However, models that achieve excellent recommendation\naccuracy on the MovieLens dataset may not demonstrate superior performance in\npractice, for at least two kinds of differences: (i) the differences in the\ncontexts of user-item interaction generation, and (ii) the differences in user\nknowledge about the item collections.

Many MOEAs have been proposed in\nthe past decades, of which the search operators need a carefully handcrafted\ndesign with domain knowledge. Recently, some attempts have been made to replace\nthe manually designed operators in MOEAs with learning-based operators (e.g.,\nneural network models). However, much effort is still required for designing\nand training such models, and the learned operators might not generalize well\non new problems. To tackle the above challenges, this work investigates a novel\napproach that leverages the powerful large language model (LLM) to design MOEA\noperators. With proper prompt engineering, we successfully let a general LLM\nserve as a black-box search operator for decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) in a\nzero-shot manner. In addition, by learning from the LLM behavior, we further\ndesign an explicit white-box operator with randomness and propose a new version\nof decomposition-based MOEA, termed MOEA/D-LO.

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias\n  in Factual Knowledge Extraction","summary":"  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from\n\"prompt bias\" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce\nbiases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

The attention directed towards hypercomplex models\noriginates from several aspects, spanning from purely theoretical and\nmathematical characteristics to the practical advantage of lightweight models\nover conventional networks, and their unique properties to capture both global\nand local relations. In particular, a branch of these architectures,\nparameterized hypercomplex neural networks (PHNNs), has also gained popularity\ndue to their versatility across a multitude of application domains.\nNonetheless, only few attempts have been made to explain or interpret their\nintricacies. In this paper, we propose inherently interpretable PHNNs and\nquaternion-like networks, thus without the need for any post-hoc method. To\nachieve this, we define a type of cosine-similarity transform within the\nparameterized hypercomplex domain.

Instead of using a sequential cross-view motion compensation like\nexisting methods, LLSS introduces a bidirectional feature shifting module to\ndirectly exploit mutual information among views and encode them effectively\nwith a joint cross-view prior model for entropy coding.

Concretely, we\nintroduce a hybrid representation called HIQuery to represent all map elements,\nand propose a point-element interactor to interactively extract and encode the\nhybrid information of elements, e.g. point position and element shape, into the\nHIQuery. Additionally, we present a point-element consistency constraint to\nenhance the consistency between the point-level and element-level information.\nFinally, the output point-element integrated HIQuery can be directly converted\ninto map elements' class, point coordinates, and mask. We conduct extensive\nexperiments and consistently outperform previous methods on both nuScenes and\nArgoverse2 datasets.

Given this action-part mapping, we combine body parts from\ntwo motions together and establish the first automated method to spatially\ncompose two actions. However, training data with compositional actions is\nalways limited by the combinatorics. Hence, we further create synthetic data\nwith this approach, and use it to train a new state-of-the-art text-to-motion\ngeneration model, called SINC (\"SImultaneous actioN Compositions for 3D human\nmotions\"). In our experiments, that training with such GPT-guided synthetic\ndata improves spatial composition generation over baselines.

Even though existing multimodal datasets\nsynergistically capture plantar pressure (foot contact) and visual signals,\nthey are specifically designed for small-range and slow motion such as Taiji\nQuan and Yoga. Therefore, there is still a lack of a vision-pressure multimodal\ndataset with large-range and fast human motion, as well as accurate and dense\nfoot-contact annotation. To fill this gap, we propose a Multimodal MoCap\nDataset with Vision and Pressure sensors, named MMVP. MMVP provides accurate\nand dense plantar pressure signals synchronized with RGBD observations, which\nis especially useful for both plausible shape estimation, robust pose fitting\nwithout foot drifting, and accurate global translation tracking. To validate\nthe dataset, we propose an RGBD-P SMPL fitting method and also a\nmonocular-video-based baseline framework, VP-MoCap, for human motion capture.\nExperiments demonstrate that our RGBD-P SMPL Fitting results significantly\noutperform pure visual motion capture.

The\nformer restricts search space to the feature field, which is too coarse to\ndetermine subtle features. They also do not filter useless feature\ninteractions, leading to higher computation costs and degraded model\nperformance. The latter identifies useful feature interaction from all\navailable features, resulting in many redundant features in the feature set.

Akin to the traditional analysis of graph Laplacians, many authors\nanalyse the smallest eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian, which are connected to\nimportant topological properties such as homology. However, small eigenvalues\nof the Hodge Laplacian can carry different information depending on whether\nthey are related to curl or gradient eigenmodes, and thus may not be\ncomparable. We therefore introduce the notion of persistent eigenvector\nsimilarity and provide a method to track individual harmonic, curl, and\ngradient eigenvectors/-values through the so-called persistence filtration,\nleveraging the full information contained in the Hodge-Laplacian spectrum\nacross all possible scales of a point cloud. Finally, we use our insights (a)\nto introduce a novel form of Hodge spectral clustering and (b) to classify\nedges and higher-order simplices based on their relationship to the smallest\nharmonic, curl, and gradient eigenvectors.\n","authors":["Vincent P.

Furthermore, generalization to unseen objects is\nhindered by the limited scale of available hand-object interaction datasets. We\npropose DiffH2O, a novel method to synthesize realistic, one or two-handed\nobject interactions from provided text prompts and geometry of the object. The\nmethod introduces three techniques that enable effective learning from limited\ndata. First, we decompose the task into a grasping stage and a text-based\ninteraction stage and use separate diffusion models for each. In the grasping\nstage, the model only generates hand motions, whereas in the interaction phase\nboth hand and object poses are synthesized. Second, we propose a compact\nrepresentation that tightly couples hand and object poses. Third, we propose\ntwo different guidance schemes to allow more control of the generated motions:\ngrasp guidance and detailed textual guidance. Grasp guidance takes a single\ntarget grasping pose and guides the diffusion model to reach this grasp at the\nend of the grasping stage, which provides control over the grasping pose. Given\na grasping motion from this stage, multiple different actions can be prompted\nin the interaction phase. For textual guidance, we contribute comprehensive\ntext descriptions to the GRAB dataset and show that they enable our method to\nhave more fine-grained control over hand-object interactions. Our quantitative\nand qualitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms\nbaseline methods and leads to natural hand-object motions.

The core of transformer architecture lies\nin the self-attention mechanism, which computes the pairwise attention scores\nin a sequence. Due to the permutation-equivariant nature, positional encoding\nis used to enhance the attention between token representations. In this\nsetting, the pairwise attention scores can be derived by both semantic\ndifference and positional difference. However, prior studies often model the\ntwo kinds of difference measurements in different ways, which potentially\nlimits the expressive capacity of sequence modeling. To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes a novel transformer variant with complex vector attention,\nnamed EulerFormer, which provides a unified theoretical framework to formulate\nboth semantic difference and positional difference. The EulerFormer involves\ntwo key technical improvements. First, it employs a new transformation function\nfor efficiently transforming the sequence tokens into polar-form complex\nvectors using Euler's formula, enabling the unified modeling of both semantic\nand positional information in a complex rotation form.Secondly, it develops a\ndifferential rotation mechanism, where the semantic rotation angles can be\ncontrolled by an adaptation function, enabling the adaptive integration of the\nsemantic and positional information according to the semantic\ncontexts.Furthermore, a phase contrastive learning task is proposed to improve\nthe anisotropy of contextual representations in EulerFormer.

Existing relative position\nencoding methods, such as those based on the ALiBi technique, address the\nlength extrapolation challenge exclusively through the implementation of a\nsingle kernel function, which introduces a constant bias to every post-softmax\nattention scores according to their distance. These approaches do not\ninvestigate or employ multiple kernel functions to address the extrapolation\nchallenge. Drawing on the ALiBi approach, this study proposes a novel relative\npositional encoding method, called MEP, which employs a weighted average to\ncombine distinct kernel functions(such as the exponential kernel and the\nGaussian kernel) to generate a bias that is applied to post-softmax attention\nscores. Initially, the framework utilizes various kernel functions to construct\nmultiple kernel functions. Each kernel function adheres to a consistent mean\nweight coefficient, harnessing the synergistic advantages of different kernels\nto formulate an innovative bias function. Subsequently, specific slopes are\ntailored for each kernel function, applying penalties at varying rates, to\nenhance the model's extrapolation capabilities. Finally, this bias is\nseamlessly incorporated as a penalty to the post-softmax scores.

However, this assumption\ncan be easily violated in real-world applications, leading to the\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) problem. Understanding how modern over-parameterized\nDNNs behave under non-trivial natural distributional shifts is essential, as\ncurrent theoretical understanding is insufficient. Existing theoretical works\noften provide meaningless results for over-parameterized models in OOD\nscenarios or even contradict empirical findings. To this end, we are\ninvestigating the performance of the over-parameterized model in terms of OOD\ngeneralization under the general benign overfitting conditions. Our analysis\nfocuses on a random feature model and examines non-trivial natural\ndistributional shifts, where the benign overfitting estimators demonstrate a\nconstant excess OOD loss, despite achieving zero excess in-distribution (ID)\nloss. We demonstrate that in this scenario, further increasing the model's\nparameterization can significantly reduce the OOD loss. Intuitively, the\nvariance term of ID loss remains low due to orthogonality of long-tail\nfeatures, meaning overfitting noise during training generally doesn't raise\ntesting loss. However, in OOD cases, distributional shift increases the\nvariance term. Thankfully, the inherent shift is unrelated to individual x,\nmaintaining the orthogonality of long-tail features. Expanding the hidden\ndimension can additionally improve this orthogonality by mapping the features\ninto higher-dimensional spaces, thereby reducing the variance term. We further\nshow that model ensembles also improve OOD loss, akin to increasing model\ncapacity.

Therefore, the challenging task of reconstructing\nvisually accurate HDR images from their Low Dynamic Range (LDR) counterparts is\ngaining attention in the vision research community. A major challenge in this\nresearch problem is the lack of datasets, which capture diverse scene\nconditions (e.g., lighting, shadows, weather, locations, landscapes, objects,\nhumans, buildings) and various image features (e.g., color, contrast,\nsaturation, hue, luminance, brightness, radiance). To address this gap, in this\npaper, we introduce GTA-HDR, a large-scale synthetic dataset of photo-realistic\nHDR images sampled from the GTA-V video game. We perform thorough evaluation of\nthe proposed dataset, which demonstrates significant qualitative and\nquantitative improvements of the state-of-the-art HDR image reconstruction\nmethods.

However, in the\nlegal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases\nare relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the\nsimilarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper\ntreatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be\nlimited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To\nthis end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case\nretrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and\npulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts\nwhile pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding\nspace in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word\nalignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder.

The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field\nparameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions\nas well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views. For evaluating our\nmethod under different scenarios, we collect a new dataset, WildDynaCap, which\ncontains subjects captured in, both, a dense camera dome and in-the-wild sparse\ncamera rigs, and demonstrate superior results compared to recent\nstate-of-the-art methods on both public and WildDynaCap dataset.\n","authors":["Guoxing Sun","Rishabh Dabral","Pascal Fua","Christian Theobalt","Marc Habermann"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18820v1.pdf","comment":"Project page: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/MetaCap/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18819v1","updated":"2024-03-27T17:59:53Z","published":"2024-03-27T17:59:53Z","title":"Benchmarking Object Detectors with COCO: A New Path Forward","summary":"  The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset has been instrumental in\nbenchmarking object detectors over the past decade.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

Specifically, our E4S performs face swapping in the latent space of a\npretrained StyleGAN, where a multi-scale mask-guided encoder is applied to\nproject the texture of each facial component into regional style codes and a\nmask-guided injection module manipulating feature maps with the style codes.\nBased on this disentanglement, face swapping can be simplified as style and\nmask swapping. Besides, due to the large lighting condition gap, transferring\nthe source skin into the target image may lead to disharmony lighting. We\npropose a re-coloring network to make the swapped face maintain the target\nlighting condition while preserving the source skin.

However, its lack of\nspatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g.,\nsemantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses\nannotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary\nproperties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated\ngood localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit\nsupervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose an\nopen-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any\nannotations. We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, which are\ncomputed with a simple modification of CLIP's last pooling layer, by\nintegrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features. By\ndoing so, we greatly improve the performance of MaskCLIP and produce smooth\noutputs. Moreover, we show that the used self-supervised feature properties can\ndirectly be learnt from CLIP features.

A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models\n(VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect\nadvanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has\nsurfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and\nLLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce\na simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is\nutilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a\nseries of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence\nof video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with\nthe spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a\nsingle composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The\nresulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while\nmaintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal\ninformation within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach\nenables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without\nnecessitating any video-data training.

Despite their\nadvancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias in the generated\ncontent, where the output is primarily influenced by the underlying Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) prior rather than the input image. Our empirical\nexperiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide\nconfident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent\nvisual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward\nvision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies. Firstly,\nfor tasks such as classification or multi-choice question-answering (QA), we\npropose a ``calibration'' step through affine transformation to adjust the\noutput distribution. This ``Post-Hoc debias'' approach ensures uniform scores\nfor each answer when the image is absent, serving as an effective\nregularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more\nintricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to ``Debias\nsampling'', drawing inspirations from contrastive decoding methods.\nFurthermore, our investigation sheds light on the instability of LVLMs across\nvarious decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different\nsettings, we significantly enhance performance, surpassing reported results and\nraising concerns about the fairness of existing evaluations.

To address\nthese issues, this study proposes a behavior-based recommender system that\nleverages customers' natural behaviors, such as browsing and clicking, on\ne-commerce platforms. The proposed recommendation system involves clustering\nactive customers, determining neighborhoods, collecting similar users,\ncalculating product reputation based on similar users, and recommending\nhigh-reputation products. To overcome the complexity of customer behaviors and\ntraditional clustering methods, an unsupervised clustering approach based on\nproduct categories is developed to enhance the recommendation methodology. This\nstudy makes notable contributions in several aspects. Firstly, a groundbreaking\nbehavior-based recommendation methodology is developed, incorporating customer\nbehavior to generate accurate and tailored recommendations leading to improved\ncustomer satisfaction and engagement. Secondly, an original unsupervised\nclustering method, focusing on product categories, enables more precise\nclustering and facilitates accurate recommendations. Finally, an approach to\ndetermine neighborhoods for active customers within clusters is established,\nensuring grouping of customers with similar behavioral patterns to enhance\nrecommendation accuracy and relevance. The proposed recommendation methodology\nand clustering method contribute to improved recommendation performance,\noffering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of\ne-commerce recommendation systems.

This task has been formulated as a\nsequence-to-sequence generation process, wherein the input sequence encompasses\ndata pertaining to the user's previously interacted items, and the output\nsequence denotes the generative identifier for the suggested item. However,\nexisting generative recommendation approaches still encounter challenges in (i)\neffectively integrating user-item collaborative signals and item content\ninformation within a unified generative framework, and (ii) executing an\nefficient alignment between content information and collaborative signals.\n  In this paper, we introduce content-based collaborative generation for\nrecommender systems, denoted as ColaRec. To capture collaborative signals, the\ngenerative item identifiers are derived from a pretrained collaborative\nfiltering model, while the user is represented through the aggregation of\ninteracted items' content. Subsequently, the aggregated textual description of\nitems is fed into a language model to encapsulate content information. This\nintegration enables ColaRec to amalgamate collaborative signals and content\ninformation within an end-to-end framework. Regarding the alignment, we propose\nan item indexing task to facilitate the mapping between the content-based\nsemantic space and the interaction-based collaborative space.

Meanwhile, owing to the use of an embedding\ntable to represent each user/item as a distinct vector, GNN-based recommenders\nhave inherited the long-standing defect of parameter inefficiency. As a common\npractice for scalable embeddings, parameter sharing enables the use of fewer\nembedding vectors (i.e., meta-embeddings). When assigning meta-embeddings, most\nexisting methods are a heuristically designed, predefined mapping from each\nuser's/item's ID to the corresponding meta-embedding indexes, thus simplifying\nthe optimization problem into learning only the meta-embeddings. However, in\nthe context of GNN-based collaborative filtering, such a fixed mapping omits\nthe semantic correlations between entities that are evident in the user-item\ninteraction graph, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To this\nend, we propose Lightweight Embeddings for Graph Collaborative Filtering\n(LEGCF), a parameter-efficient embedding framework dedicated to GNN-based\nrecommenders. LEGCF innovatively introduces an assignment matrix as an extra\nlearnable component on top of meta-embeddings. To jointly optimize these two\nheavily entangled components, aside from learning the meta-embeddings by\nminimizing the recommendation loss, LEGCF further performs efficient assignment\nupdate by enforcing a novel semantic similarity constraint and finding its\nclosed-form solution based on matrix pseudo-inverse.

Most of the existing works focus on improving\nthe representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token\nand calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the\nlegal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases\nare relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the\nsimilarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper\ntreatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be\nlimited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To\nthis end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case\nretrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and\npulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts\nwhile pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding\nspace in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word\nalignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder. First, we leverage\nshallow decoders to create information bottlenecks, aiming to enhance the\nrepresentation ability. Second, we employ the deep decoder to enable\ntranslation between different structures, with the goal of pinpointing key\nfacts to enhance discriminative ability.

This poses several unique challenges for click-through rate (CTR)\nprediction. Due to limited user interactions for each product (i.e. item), the\ncorresponding item embedding in the CTR model may not easily converge. This\nmakes the conventional sequence modeling based approaches cannot effectively\nutilize user history information since historical user behaviors contain a\nmixture of items with different volume of stocks. Particularly, the attention\nmechanism in a sequence model tends to assign higher score to products with\nmore accumulated user interactions, making limited-stock products being ignored\nand contribute less to the final output. To this end, we propose the Meta-Split\nNetwork (MSNet) to split user history sequence regarding to the volume of stock\nfor each product, and adopt differentiated modeling approaches for different\nsequences. As for the limited-stock products, a meta-learning approach is\napplied to address the problem of inconvergence, which is achieved by designing\nmeta scaling and shifting networks with ID and side information. In addition,\ntraditional approach can hardly update item embedding once the product is\nconsumed.

However, existing methods rely on manually\npredefined relations and suffer the sparsity issue, limiting the generalization\nability in diverse scenarios with varied item relations. In this paper, we\npropose a novel relation-aware sequential recommendation framework with Latent\nRelation Discovery (LRD).

In this paper, we challenge\nsuch an equal training assumption and propose a novel one backpropagation\nupdating strategy, which keeps the normal gradient backpropagation for the item\nencoding tower, but cuts off the backpropagation for the user encoding tower.\nInstead, we propose a moving-aggregation updating strategy to update a user\nencoding in each training epoch. Except the proposed backpropagation updating\nmodule, we implement the other three modules with the most straightforward\nchoices.

In many cases, the data is not\nhomogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to\nmake it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to\nbe an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good\nresults, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training\nslow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also\nproposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the\ntraining starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch\nduring the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated\ndataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures. The results\nshow that if the data is homogeneously sampled the methodology works as\nintended and produces accurate survival models. The results also show that\nrandomly resampling the dataset on each epoch is an effective way to reduce the\nsize of the training data.\n","authors":["Olov Holmer","Mattias Krysander","Erik Frisk"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18739v1.pdf","comment":"7 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18735v1","updated":"2024-03-27T16:24:26Z","published":"2024-03-27T16:24:26Z","title":"Nonlinear model reduction for operator learning","summary":"  Operator learning provides methods to approximate mappings between\ninfinite-dimensional function spaces.

Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g.,\ncontent, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant\nchallenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into\nindividual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them\nindividually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with\nnovel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot\nway.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,\nwe show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by\n$\\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,\n$\\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations.

The effects of such heterogeneity\nplay an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to\ndiscover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from\nexperimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this\nend, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO)\napproach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic\nmaterials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with\nthe material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation\nfield, from loading field-displacement field measurements.

Firstly, we learn a homogeneous\nconstitutive law in the form of a neural network-based kernel function and a\nnonlocal bond force, to capture complex homogeneous material responses from\ndata. Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the\nkernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for\neach material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our\nHeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear\nand angular momentum guaranteed. Moreover, the effects from heterogeneity and\nnonlinear constitutive relationship are captured by the kernel function and the\nbond force respectively, enabling physical interpretability.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

Although CNN-based methods have been adapted to IR drop\nprediction task in several works, the shortcomings of overlooking PDN\nconfiguration is non-negligible. In this paper, we consider not only how to\nproperly represent cell-PDN relation, but also how to model IR drop following\nits physical nature in the feature aggregation procedure. Thus, we propose a\nnovel graph structure, PDNGraph, to unify the representations of the PDN\nstructure and the fine-grained cell-PDN relation.

This study investigates the potential of utilizing machine\nlearning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), to assess the\nlithology and mineral content solely from analysis of drill core images, aiming\nto support and expedite the subsurface geological exploration. The paper\noutlines a comprehensive methodology, encompassing data preprocessing, machine\nlearning methods, and transfer learning techniques. The outcome reveals a\nremarkable 96.7% accuracy in the classification of drill core segments into\ndistinct formation classes. Furthermore, a CNN model was trained for the\nevaluation of mineral content using a learning data set from multidimensional\nlog analysis data (silicate, total clay, carbonate). When benchmarked against\nlaboratory XRD measurements on samples from the cores, both the advanced\nmultidimensional log analysis model and the neural network approach developed\nhere provide equally good performance. This work demonstrates that deep\nlearning and particularly transfer learning can support extracting\npetrophysical properties, including mineral content and formation\nclassification, from drill core images, thus offering a road map for enhancing\nmodel performance and data set quality in image-based analysis of drill cores.\n","authors":["Romana Boiger","Sergey V.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, proposed a\nstandard method for ET0 computation (FAO56PM), based on the parameterization of\nthe Penman-Monteith equation, that is widely adopted in the literature. To\ncompute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:\ntemperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily\nET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast\nservices (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the\nnext 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided\nas a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,\nsuch forecasts present a financial cost penalty. For this reason, several ET0\nestimation models using machine and deep learning were developed and presented\nin the literature, that use as input features a reduced set of carefully\nselected weather parameters, that are compatible with common freely available\nWFSs. However, most studies on this topic have only evaluated model performance\nusing data from weather stations (WSs), without considering the effect of using\nweather forecast data. In this study, the performance of authors' previous\nmodels is evaluated when using weather forecast data from two online WFSs, in\nthe following scenarios: (i) direct ET0 estimation by an ANN model, and (ii)\nestimate SR by ANN model, and then use that estimation for ET0 computation,\nusing the FAO56-PM method.

However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework,\ncalled Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose\nestimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant\nframes and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose\ntokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model\nefficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster\n(TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic\ndiversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we\ndevelop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed\nspatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the\nnetwork output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast\ninference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and\nMPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and\nestimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models.

Interestingly, even though they\ncommonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future\npaths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures\nfor each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can\nlead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory,\na diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the\nperformance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to\nunify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To\ndo this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion\npatterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive\nanchor working in the Singular space.

The transformed numerical and image data\nare then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language\nmodel. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning\nhigh-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between\npedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering.

Firstly, they often rely on Euclidean distance to measure\nsimilarity when constructing the adaptive neighbor graph, which proves\ninadequate in capturing the intrinsic structure among data points in many\nreal-world scenarios.

In response to the\naforementioned drawbacks, we in this paper propose a novel tensor-based graph\nlearning framework that simultaneously considers consistency and specificity\nfor multi-view clustering. Specifically, we calculate the similarity distance\non the Stiefel manifold to preserve the intrinsic structure among data points.\nBy making an assumption that the learned neighbor graph of each view comprises\nboth a consistent graph and a view-specific graph, we formulate a new\ntensor-based target graph learning paradigm. Owing to the benefits of tensor\nsingular value decomposition (t-SVD) in uncovering high-order correlations,\nthis model is capable of achieving a complete understanding of the target\ngraph.
